# Overview
Alright, so I was bored one night and had an interview comming up. 
A few months ago, a friend of mine raged about how shockingly few people were able to solve this problem durng interview:

> Given a list of a class that contains 3 fields
>
> Group the list by one field, sort the list by another, and return the top n of each group

The problem isn't difficult (though it's _plagued_ by ambiguity, which in my opinion makes this question a great interview question because it really lets you see how a candidate approaches an ambiguous problem--which in my opinion is incredibly valuable) but I found it to be a good excersize to get my mind back in "interview mode" and brush up on a bit of my python...

_Note: I'm not a python expect--though I really like python. While I do my best to write clean code, I'm honestly not going to bother cleaning up code that will likely have no audience besides maybe a couple students looking up how to implement a doubly linked list in python_
